Welcome to the Express.js Starter with Go Integration project! This starter template is designed to streamline the process of creating new Express.js projects while leveraging the power and efficiency of the Go programming language (Golang).

## Requirements

- **Go**: The Go programming language is required to run the Go server. You can download and install Go from the official website: [https://golang.org/](https://golang.org/).
- **Node.js**: Node.js is required to run the Express.js server. You can download and install Node.js from the official website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. in the root directory of the project, run the following command to build the Go CLI:

```bash
go build
```

3. execute the program compiled in the previous step:

```bash
./go-express-initializer
```

4. In a new terminal, navigate to the `express` directory and install the required Node.js packages:

```bash
cd project_name_chosen
npm install
```

enjoy!
